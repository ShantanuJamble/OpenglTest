# Storm-breaker
StormBreaker is a game engine I am working on for trying out and implement new concepts. The main focus of the engine currently is implementing a graphics engine and adding support for the editor to make scene changes easier. I don't want it to support a specific sort of game play, but the main focus here is implementing cool graphics. 

  Currently, it has Following implementations in place,

  1.Engine systems - 

      - Renderer & Mesh-Material System

      - Editor support with ImGui

      - Events System

      - Shader support 

      - Debug Systems (Logger, Memory leak detections)

      - Helper tools/Scripts (Premake, System setup scripts)

  2. Editor support & easy mechanics to add new editor functionality with layered system

  3. Data-Oriented ECS (in works)

 

On the Graphics side, currently, the following effects are in works,

    PBR (in works)
    HDR skybox
    Water Simulation
